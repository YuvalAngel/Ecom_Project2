As of 05/11/2025:
Current best algorithm is probably UCB, followed by the Recommender class model, then base Thompson.
Epsilon-Greedy Performs poorly, the introduction of the improved model, which uses 
Need to see what's the reason for it, might give us insight as to how to improve other models.

Plans for tomorrow:
Try improving the good performing models, look into research in the area and see if there are other models we can implement.

Today's best result: UCB with c = 0.21, Test 1 avg: 7427.64, Test 2 avg: 2306, Test 3 avg: 4610, Total: 14292

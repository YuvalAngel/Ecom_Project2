As of 05/11/2025:
Current best algorithm is probably UCB, followed by the Recommender class model, then base Thompson.
Epsilon-Greedy Performs poorly, the introduction of the improved model, which uses 
Need to see what's the reason for it, might give us insight as to how to improve other models.

Plans for tomorrow:
Try improving the good performing models, look into research in the area and see if there are other models we can implement.

Today's best result: UCB with c = 0.21, Test 1 avg: 7427.64, Test 2 avg: 2306, Test 3 avg: 4610, Total: 14292

06/11/2025:
Implemented a new feasible set function, currently only improves Thompson Sampling, Recommender tiny difference and the others are worse off.
Left the lines there in the recommenders, needs more tests to see if we can maybe improve the current implementation to actually make them better.
-- EpsilonGreedy: EpsilonGreedy is underperforming consistently, and EpsilonGreedyImproved is Performing very well. This has been the case up until now, and i don't think there's really a point in keeping it
So, removing EpsilonGreedy, and naming the new EpsilonGreedyImproved EpsilonGreedy.
